Thaw now have two basic subcommand: `init` and 'submit'.

# init

Init a directory with corresponding operation.

Only need an argument like `thaw init path`.

Thaw can distinguish three kinds of directories.

## The directory of all the repositories

It has a `compile_args.yml` with the arguments for compilation, which can be called when user submit a code.

Thaw will init any directories without any features by adding a `compile_args.yml`.

## Directory of a repository of problems

It is a git repository, and a subdirectory of the directory of all the repositories.

User should init the directory manually by `git init`.

## Directory of a single problem

It has a `config.yml` with all of information of the problem, and it is a subdirectory of the directory of a repository of problems.

Thaw will init a subdirectory of the directory of a repository of problems by adding a `config.yml`.

# submit

Uncompleted.

Submit a code and judge it.

Use it like `submit [path_of_your_code] [--gen] [--std] [--time] [--memory] [--seed] [--no-delete]`.

`path_of_your_code` must be in a directory of a problem.

- gen: The data generator.
- std: The standard code.
- time: customlized time limit.
- memory: customlized memory limit.
- seed: random seed for pseudorandom.
- no-delete: not delete the executable file generated by complier.

It will run the `checker.py` in the directory of the problem.

The `checker.py` should use the API by `import thaw.checker`.

See `./manual_checker.md`.
